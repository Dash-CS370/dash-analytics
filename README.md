## Backend Installation
To run the backend, we need to start 4 different Springboot Microservices in the order given below:
These microservices are found in the `/Dash-backend/` directory at the root of the project. 
Since this is a Maven-based project, the JAR files are typically generated in each microservice's `target` folder. 
Before you start, ensure you've run the Maven build process to create these JAR files
using the following commands:

```bash
   cd /Dash-backend/Eureka-Server/
   mvn clean install
```
```bash
   cd /Dash-backend/OAuthorization-Server/
   mvn clean install
```
```bash
   cd /Dash-backend/Resource-Server/
   mvn clean install
```
```bash
   cd /Dash-backend/Dashboard-Service/
   mvn clean install
```


1. **Eureka Server**
   - **Description**: Eureka is a service discovery server. It helps other microservices discover each other and maintain their registration.
   - **Startup Command**: 
     ```bash
     cd /Dash-backend/Eureka-Server/target
     java -jar Eureka-Server.jar
     ```

2. **OAuth Authorization Server**
   - **Description**: This service handles user authentication and issues OAuth tokens for authorized access to other services.
   - **Startup Command**:
     ```bash
     cd /Dash-backend/OAuthorization-Server/target
     java -jar OAuthorization-Server.jar
     ```

3. **Resource Server**
   - **Description**: The resource server provides protected resources to authenticated clients based on OAuth tokens.
   - **Startup Command**:
     ```bash
     cd /Dash-backend/Resource-Server/target
     java -jar Resource-Server.jar
     ```

4. **Dashboard Service**
   - **Description**: The dashboard service is the central service for which the resources and authentication is handled through in this ecosystem.
   - **Startup Command**:
     ```bash
     cd /Dash-backend/Dashboard-Service/target
     java -jar Dashboard-Service.jar
     ```

## Notes
- Make sure the TCP ports 8080, 8081, 9000, and 8761 are not occupied before running these commands.
- To ensure proper communication between servers, add an alias for `127.0.0.1` in `hosts.conf`:
  ```bash
  echo "127.0.0.1 auth-server" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
